# My LaTeX Resume

A clean, ATS-friendly resume template for developers who want something that actually works.

## What's This?

My personal resume built in LaTeX. It's optimized for those pesky ATS systems and looks pretty good too. Specializes in frontend/Web3 stuff but you can adapt it for whatever.

## How to Use

**Step 1:** Go to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)  
**Step 2:** Upload `main.tex`  
**Step 3:** Edit with your own info  
**Step 4:** Download PDF  
**Step 5:** Get that job

That's it. No LaTeX installation headaches, no command line nonsense.

## What's Inside

- Frontend Developer experience (React, Next.js, TypeScript)
- Web3 projects (NEAR Protocol, BOS Framework) 
- Performance optimizations and testing
- Clean technical skills section
- Real project links that actually work

## Want to Customize?

Just replace my info with yours. The structure is pretty self-explanatory. Change the projects, update the skills, fix the contact details.

**Pro tip:** Keep the same format - it plays nice with ATS systems.
